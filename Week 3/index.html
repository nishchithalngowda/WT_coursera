              Understanding a Little Chemistry

Before you start thinking about which sauces to use or what to garnish your plate with, you should refresh on a few safety tips. If you’re familiar with your deep fryer, no doubt you already know the safety basics. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is that oil and water do not mix — ever. Mixing oil and water at a high temperature is a severe safety hazard. Water is a denser liquid than oil, which causes it to sink. If there is water in your deep fryer oil, this will cause bubbles to rise to the surface. These bubbles can pop, splattering you and your kitchen with scalding hot oil. The bottom line is that frozen chicken wings are full of ice crystals (water), so defrost them completely before using your deep fryer. 

How to Prepare the Chicken Wings

Once the wings are defrosted completely, pat them dry. Before adding them to the deep fryer, you may want to season them with salt and ground black pepper or shake them with a seasoned flour mixture to make them crispier on the outside. A simple way to do this is to mix flour along with your favorite seasonings, such as garlic powder and cayenne pepper, in a resealable plastic bag. Add the wings, close the bag, and toss them until they are coated. Once you remove them, shake off the excess flour. 

How to Prepare the Oil

Whether you have a deep fryer or are heating oil up in a large Dutch oven or pan, the oil should reach a temperature of between 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit to cook the wings thoroughly. Wings should stay in the oil from approximately 10 minutes, although larger wings may need more time to cook throughout. Once wings are cooked, place them on a plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil.

How to Prepare Wings With Sauce

You can either make your own buffalo wing sauce with hot sauce and butter or buy a bottled version at the store. You can also choose from an array of different sauces, such as teriyaki, chili sauce, barbecue, and more. Once the wings are cooked thoroughly, place them and your desired sauce in a container with a lid. Close the lid and shake well to coat the wings with sauce. A word of caution, however. If the wings have just come out of the fryer and are extremely hot, this may cause a lid to burst. In this case, toss them in a bowl and mix them with a cooking utensil like tongs. 

How to Serve Buffalo Wings

Buffalo wings are generally served with either blue cheese or ranch dressing (or both), even if you’ve used sauces other than buffalo. Restaurants also commonly serve buffalo wings with celery and carrot sticks, to soothe the palate in between bites of spicy wings. You may want to experiment with buffalo wing sauces and levels of heat so that you can serve mild, medium, and hot selections.


The typical meat-eating American eats hundreds of chicken wings per year. The chicken wing frenzy hits an all-time high right around the National Football League's annual Super Bowl, when Americans eat more than one billion wings, according to the National Chicken Council. To enjoy wings fully, they need to be cooked safely and properly.

How Long Chicken Wings Should Be Deep Fried

No matter if you're using a deep frying appliance or frying without a deep fryer, heating the oil to the right temperature is the first step in achieving perfectly cooked wings. Preheat the oil to 375 F, using a candy thermometer or a deep frying thermometer to make sure the oil is at the right temperature. Avoid adding too many wings at once for even cooking. After eight to 10 minutes, the wings should be golden and tender. 

Making Sure Wings Are Fully Cooked

Undercooked chicken wings can be harmful to your health. Make sure they're fully cooked for optimal food safety. Remove them from the oil, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate, and use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. The USDA recommends cooking chicken wings to an internal temperature of 165 F. If the wings register a lower temperature, add them back to the hot oil or finish them in the oven.

Not All Oils Are Created Equally

Timing is everything, but oil is important too. The best oils to use for frying have a smoking point that's higher than your cooking temperature. When the oil starts smoking, you can't use it. That's why butter, shortening, and extra virgin olive oil aren't used for deep frying. 

High Smoke Point Oils for Deep Frying

Some oils add a little flavor to the mix. For example, peanut oil adds a hint of nuttiness when you fry with it. Others, like vegetable, canola, and avocado oil are neutral. Curious about each oil's approximate smoke point? 

Peanut oil: 450 F
Palm oil: 450 F
Corn oil: 450 F
Vegetable oil: 400 F
Canola oil: 400 F
Grapeseed oil: 420 F
Avocado oil: 520 F
Sunflower seed oil: 440 to 450 F
Sesame oil: 410 F
How Much Oil Should You Use?

The type of oil isn't the only important factor. The amount matters too. You don't want to skimp on it, and you don't want to overdo the oil. Without enough oil, the wings won't get fully submerged, which is necessary for efficient cooking. Too much oil and you can end up with messy splatters that could pose a safety concern. Allow several inches between the top of the fryer or pot and the oil to minimize bubbles and splatters. 

Deep Frying Without a Deep Fryer

Having a deep fryer is convenient, but it's not the only way to deep fry chicken wings and other foods. All you need is a large pot or pan with high sides. To prevent hot oil spills, the sides of the pan should be at least 4 inches higher than the level of oil. Use just enough to give wings and other items room to submerge in the oil, as recommended by Modernist Cuisine.  

Patting food dry before you fry is another way to minimize spatters. To deep fry, preheat the oil to the desired temperature and cook in batches for optimal consistency. Watch the time and use a spider or wire basket to lift food out of the oil and onto paper towels to drain it.
